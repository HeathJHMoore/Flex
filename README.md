# FLEX Workout Program Application
FLEX is an application designed to help users easily implement the principle of progressive overload into their workout routines. All effective workout programs should implement this principle but, unfortunately, very few do. My goal for this application was to automate the implementation of progressive overload in workout routines so that myself and other gym-goers can free our minds of worrying about it

# What is Progressive Overload and Why is it important?
In order for muscles to grow in size and strength, you must consistently expose them to incrementally higher resistance (AKA lift more weight) and volume (AKA complete more repetitions). Many people fail to realize the importance of this principle, and, as result, see a sharp plateau in their strength and size gains over time. This experience is frustrating and demoralizing as you feel like all of your hard work in the gym is being done in vain. For some, the frustration of plateuaing can lead to halting exercise altogether, which is the last thing we want to happen. So, in an effort to take the headache and effort out of incorporating progressive overload into your own workouts, I built an application that will do it for you!


# How the application works
Start by creating a user account on the sign-on landing page. This step is made easy by using your google acccount for authentication!

After logging in, you are taken to the "My Dashboard" page where you can see all of your workout routines. You obviously won't have any routines yet so lets go ahead and make your first workout routine.

At the top of the My Dashboard page, click the Create New Workout button.
