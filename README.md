# FLEX Workout Program Application
FLEX is an application designed to help users easily implement the principle of progressive overload into their workout routines. All effective workout programs should implement this principle but, unfortunately, very few do. 

# What is Progressive Overload and Why is it important?
In order for muscles to grow in size and strength, you must consistently expose them to incrementally higher resistance (weight) and volume (repetitions). Many people fail to realize the importance of this principle, and, as result, see a sharp plateau in their strength and size gains over time. This experience is frustrating and demoralizing as you feel like all of your hard work in the gym is being done in vain. For some, the frustration of plateuaing can lead to halting exercise altogether since it seems as though.
